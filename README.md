# Call-Summaries
This code will read all SonoBat txt files in a single folder and create a dataframe with # of calls/night per species both SppAccp and ~Spp (accepting only >=call matching threshold  you set)

You can re-run this code each time you add a "cummulative sonobatch" txt file and your summary dataframe/csv will update with that new data. 

Note that I follow specific naming conventions that are included in this code - each site starts with "T".
